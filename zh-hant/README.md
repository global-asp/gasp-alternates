# Chinese stories in traditional characters

This folder contains Chinese (Mandarin) translations of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) in [traditional Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters), as used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and many overseas communities.

## Conventions

The text is identical to that in the main repo, but all characters use their traditional/complex forms.
